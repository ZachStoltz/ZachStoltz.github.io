    <strong>Welcome and thanks for stopping by!</strong>  My name is Zachary/Zach and I am a Front-end Engineer from Pennsylvania, residing in Maryland.
    I like all things front-end, especially JavaScript.  Recently, I have been getting more involved with newer JavaScript Frameworks like
    AngularJS and ReactJS (which this site is tinkered on with).  I like to contribute to open source and read up on all the latest things
    JavaScript.  Take a look around at the site and view my random thoughts in my repos that I have under my <a href="#projects"><span>Hacklings</span></a>.
    I hope you enjoy!  If you would like to talk JS with me or have an awesome idea for a new project, feel free to tweet me, or email me at:
